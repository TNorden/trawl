# Proxy overview

TRAWL can expose a general HTTP/HTTPS forward proxy, normally on port `8192`. It behaves like a
direct proxy for ordinary traffic and invokes the existing `/scrape` tier pipeline only when a
small buffered response looks like a supported challenge.

The proxy is disabled by default. It is intended for trusted clients on localhost, a private LAN,
or a private container network.

```

HTTPS requires local TLS termination so TRAWL can inspect the response body. TRAWL generates a
per-host certificate signed by its own root CA. The client must trust that root certificate.

## Direct forwarding

Tier 0 opens a normal TCP or TLS connection to the destination and forwards the request method,
body, and end-to-end headers. It preserves headers such as:

- `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `User-Agent`, `Referer`, and `Origin`
- custom API headers
- `Range`, `If-Range`, cache validators, and content metadata

Hop-by-hop headers are rebuilt or removed at the proxy boundary.

Responses not selected by the streaming policy—including small HTML, JSON, XML, text, and unknown
small payloads—are buffered. Compressed `gzip`, `deflate`, and Brotli responses are decoded only
for challenge inspection; the original bytes remain the response body. Chunked buffered responses
are de-chunked before being returned.

## Challenge escalation

When Tier 0 detects a supported challenge wall, the request is passed to the same `scrape()`
orchestrator used by `POST /scrape`:

1. plain HTTP fetch;
2. cached browser session;
3. fresh browser challenge solve;
4. residential proxy solve, when configured.

For browser-tier HTML responses, the proxy returns the rendered solved DOM rather than the original
challenge response. Binary responses use the raw response bytes when the winning tier exposes them.

A hostname that produced a supported challenge wall is cached for five minutes. During that window,
later requests for the hostname skip Tier 0 and go directly to the tiered solver.

Challenge and CAPTCHA solving is best effort. A site can still reject the browser, require user
interaction, bind clearance to an unsupported signal, or change its challenge implementation.
When the final browser tier stops on such a wall, the proxy returns its bounded rendered HTML with
the upstream status code and `X-Trawl-Status: blocked` instead of disguising it as a gateway outage.
`X-Trawl-Reason` identifies the detected wall when available. Network, browser-pool, and other
infrastructure failures still return `502 Bad Gateway`.

## Buffering and streaming

The proxy buffers ordinary responses by default so challenge detection sees the complete body.
It streams when at least one of these applies:

- `Content-Length` is at least 8 MiB;
- the content type is `video/*` or `audio/*`;
- an unknown-length response has a known binary content type;
- the URL has a known media, archive, installer, disk-image, PDF, or font extension.

Streaming keeps large files out of TRAWL's memory. Streamed responses bypass body-based challenge
detection, so the policy intentionally targets content that is unlikely to be an HTML challenge.

`Range` requests are forwarded unchanged. A compliant upstream `206 Partial Content` response,
including `Content-Range` and `Accept-Ranges`, is passed back to the client. If the Range response
is instead a detectable challenge page, it can escalate through the normal solver pipeline.

## WebSockets

HTTP and HTTPS WebSocket upgrade requests use a bidirectional byte relay after the upstream
`101 Switching Protocols` response. WebSocket frames are not buffered or interpreted.

The WebSocket handshake does not escalate through the browser solver. If a WebSocket endpoint
requires a clearance cookie, the client must already have suitable credentials or obtain them
through a preceding solved HTTP flow.

## Current protocol boundaries

The current listener is an HTTP/1.1 proxy:

- one request is served per proxied TLS connection;
- HTTP keep-alive and pipelining are not reused;
- request bodies use `Content-Length`; chunked uploads are not decoded;
- duplicate upstream response headers are represented by the first observed value;
- proxy authentication is not implemented;
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are not terminated between the client and TRAWL.

On a challenged request, the browser fallback converts a request body to UTF-8 because the public
scrape contract currently accepts a string body. Ordinary direct forwarding preserves binary
request bodies exactly.

## Proxy versus API endpoints

| Interface          | Best for                                     | Response handling                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /v1`         | FlareSolverr-compatible integrations         | Returns HTML, cookies, and user agent                   |
| `POST /scrape`     | Native programmatic scraping                 | Returns tier metadata and solved content                |
| HTTP proxy `:8192` | Applications that perform their own requests | Forwards HTTP traffic and escalates detected challenges |

Use `/v1` or `/scrape` when the application explicitly supports a solver API. Use the proxy when the
application only knows how to make ordinary HTTP requests or when cookie handoff is not sufficient.
